    "According to the United Nations, one in three people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water. Unsafe water is a leading risk factor for death, especially at low incomes, and is one of the world's largest health and environmental problems. Groundwater pollution occurs when pollutants are released into the ground and make their way down into groundwater. While water contamination can occur from naturally occurring contaminants, such as arsenic or fluoride, common causes of water pollution are on-site sanitation systems, effluent from wastewater treatment plants, petrol filling stations or agricultural fertilizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to prevent outbreaks and incidents of water poisonings, detecting ground-water contamination is crucial. Geostatistics has often utilized the Gaussian Process (GP) to model the spatial pattern of pollutant concentrations in the ground. Usually, a data point in 2D represents a geological well where a sample was taken from a bore hole to measure concentration of pollutants.\n",
